# BirdsnetWebsite
This is a capstone project, we are making a website for the J Birdsnest Inc.

For this project we are using HTML, CSS and plan to implement JavaScript, as well as some React.

Our goal for this project is to be able to give the Birdsnest restaurant an easy way to add/remove
items from their menu, update prices as needed, as well as create an easier option for customers to
be able to view food and beverage menus.
