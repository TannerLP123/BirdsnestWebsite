# Planning

## Frontend
What pages do we need? 
It'll essentially be 2 pages
1. Home / Landing page:
- Including Hours, Images, Socials, Address etc.

2. Menu page:
- Food, Cocktails, Beer components (toggle through each)

start by creating main component with routes to the home and menu pages
fetch menu items into state and map over each conditionally dependent on the choice of user

the rest is tailwind styling to finish it offf

## Backend

create erds
create templates
input all the menu data into mongo etc
